<div class="jel-main-content">
    Thank you very much for being a member of the extended product development team. Thanks to your input, we are now rolling out the best cloud-based Java and PHP hosting platform available today. ${HOSTER_NAME} just made the seamless transition from free beta to commercial release. This has no impact on any applications you may have been running on your beta test environments. However, it means that, once you elect to begin paying for your environment, all beta test restrictions on your parameters will be removed or greatly increased.
    <br>
    <br>Please note that -- unless you convert to a fully funded account -- when trial period&nbsp;ends in <strong>14 days</strong>, your beta environment will be stopped, and any data stored in it will be destroyed.
    <br>
    <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">To remove all limitations from your ${HOSTER_NAME} account right now just go to <a  href="${URL_DASHBOARD}" target="_blank">${URL_DASHBOARD}</a>, log in, and click the "Upgrade trial account" link in ${HOSTER_NAME} dashboard.</span>
    <br>
    <br>Thanks again for joining the ${HOSTER_NAME} family. We look forward to having you on board as a full customer soon!

    <br><strong>Result</strong>:
    <br>Collectively, all ${NODE_NAME}(s) nodes(s) are consuming ${CPU_USED}MHz (${CLOUDLETS_USED} cloudlets worth; if this load is sustained for 1 hour). This represents ${LOAD_VALUE}% of the CPU limit currently configured for this environment (via Cloudlet Scaling Limit).

    <div class="highlighted-block">
        <ul> #if(${TRIGGER_CONDITION_TYPE}=="GREATER")

            <li> By adjusting the Cloudlet Scaling Limit, you are allowing your ${NODE_NAME} to access more resources (Dynamic Cloudlets). You are only charged for Dynamic Cloudlets in use (setting a high maximum limit does not imply a high charge: you are only charged for periods where those resources are actively used). </li>
            <li> Using Cloudlets, Jelastic's automatic vertical scaling saves you money, automatically scaling down as soon as intensive ${NODE_NAME} activity is completed. </li>

            <li>A Cloudlet is a composite unit of RAM and CPU. Your hourly charges are composed of Cloudlet usage (highest of peak RAM, or average CPU) split into Reserved and Dynamic Cloudlets. </li>
            <li>By adjusting the Cloudlet Scaling Limit, you are allowing your ${NODE_NAME} to access more resources (Dynamic Cloudlets). You are only charged for Dynamic Cloudlets in use (setting a high maximum limit does not imply a high charge: you are only charged for periods where those resources are actively used). </li>
            <li>Using Cloudlets, Jelastic's automatic vertical scaling saves you money, automatically scaling down as soon as intensive ${NODE_NAME} activity is completed.</li>

    <p>The ${TRIGGER_NAME} alert has been executed. <strong>${NODE_NAME}</strong> node(s) in environment <strong>${ENV_NAME}</strong> attempted to use more RAM than it&rsquo;s provided (${RAM_LIMIT_MB} MiB per node) by the maximum cloudlet limit you&rsquo;ve configured (${RAM_LIMIT_CLOUDLETS} cloudlets per node).</p>As a result, the following processes were killed by the OOM killer at <strong>${NODE_NAME}</strong> container(s):
    <br> ${OOM_REPORT}
    <p>Currently <strong>${NODE_NAME}</strong> consumes ${CLOUDLETS_USED} cloudlet(s) (approximately ${MEM_USED} MiB) that is ${LOAD_VALUE}% of available resources.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: During an emergency memory shortage, OOM killer attempts to free the maximum amount of memory by killing the least processes possible. Thus, the processes killed may not always indicate the processes that were causing an unexpectedly high memory load.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommended Actions</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Review the <a href="${AUTH_ENV_EVENTS_HISTORY_OOM}" target="_blank">OOM Killer alert history</a> in your dashboard</li>
        <li>Check if your application was affected by the process(es) killed</li>
        <li>Increase the cloudlet limit to allow <strong>${NODE_NAME}</strong> to access more RAM when needed</li>
        <li>Restart <strong>${ENV_NAME}</strong> to ensure all necessary processes are running</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The more detailed guidance applicable to the affected process(es), how to analyse the issue in more detail, and how to avoid it in future can be found in our <a href="https://docs.jelastic.com/oom-killer-troubleshooting">documentation</a>. #set($reminder =${REMINDER_PERIOD} / 60)</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: #if($reminder != 0) Further messages about OOM kills on <strong>${NODE_NAME}</strong> will be suppressed for the next $reminder hour(s)&nbsp;to avoid flooding your mailbox. You can adjust this interval within the <a href="${URL_DOCS_ENV_ALERTS_EDIT}" target="_blank">load alert settings</a> in the dashboard. #else You are currently receiving immediate notifications for each OOM kill. You can suppress additional messages by adjusting the notification interval within the <a href="${URL_DOCS_ENV_ALERTS_EDIT}" target="_blank">load alert settings</a> in the dashboard #end</p>
